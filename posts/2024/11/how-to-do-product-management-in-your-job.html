                    You are a mid-level Product Manager, doing good amount of work at your job, acheveing good results, but wanted to learn more about how to actually do the Product Management.</p><p>
                    You always wonder, if what you are currently doing is the ideal approach, am i following the "Best Practices" that you heard in some XYZ conference?</p><p>
                    Why aren't you able to apply some "Jargin" framework promorted by some Dr Strange.</p><p>
                    You already goone thru various Youtube videos, articles and what not, still imposter syndrome creeps in.</p><p>
                </br>
                Don't worry, you are not alone, we all went to the same path and learned.</p><p>
                Hence i thought to share my two cents here so as to save you all from endless hours of anxiety and frustation.</p><p>
