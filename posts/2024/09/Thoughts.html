                <p>
                    Countless thoughts about life, career, family, world and what not. Why only in night you ask?</p><p> I think it's because of the inherent properties of the night that help create an atmosphere which fuels thoughts, both good and bad, depends in which
                    frame you are.
                    Quite, calm, almost no sound, you begin to imagine, all you have to do is to feel the night, away from smartphones, notifications, YouTube, Netflix, Fb, Insta.
                    Just lie down, relax (if you can) and let your mind wander, same as i am doing.</p><p>
                    I started with some specific work to accomplice but ended up jotting down thoughts.
                    <br>
                    What i wanted to be, how life would be going forward, and other shit. </p><p>Even getting ideas on following the passion as YouTube Self-Help Gurus tell, the issue is what passion i have, and which to follow?
                    <br>
                    I realized now, why successful people give advice of starting to journal or blog, It do feels so good to write.
                    And now i realized this was something i use to enjoy, i wrote stories, fiction, lengthy essays, etc, but with fast moving work and life this was kind of lost.
                    <br>
                    I am thinking now to start writing couple of blog posts in a month. Let's see.</p><p>
